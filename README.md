I'm a college student, studying computer science. This assignment was part of a second year Web Development module. The HTML and the CSS files were provided, I had to write a JavaScript file to modify the page based on the following criteria:

1. The indented, pale grey items (child menus) in the left-hand navigation menu ("Home", "Work", etc.) should initially be hidden, and only re-appear whilst the mouse pointer hovers over their parent item (shown in darker grey) in the menu.

2. The small image in the header of the "Friends" box should cycle through the images of the all the friends in the list, changing every 3 seconds. You can assume that the list of 4 friends is fixed.

3. Clicking on the "Like" link on a message should highlight the message by shading it pale yellow and turn the link into an "Unlike" link, which reverses this process. Clicking on the "Hide" link should hide themessage from view.

4. Clicking on the "Refresh" link in the top right-hand corner should display all the new messages at the top of the message list (prepend) with the user image/avatar for each message. The new messages for you to use are stored in “newsfeeddemodata.txt”.The new messages must be added to the DOM. In other words, hitting the Refresh button should create new “divs” (and other associated DOM elements) with content based on the text as provided.

I didn't have to create a cross-browser solution, I tested the results in Firefox only.

As this is my first repo I would really appreciate your opinion. Even a little advice would be great about how to write a good readme file.
